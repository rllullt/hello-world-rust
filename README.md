# Hello World Rust

Simple project for learning the Rust language.
It follows mainly ‘The Rust Programming Language’ book, and also some tutorial or course that, unfortunately, I don’t remember and didn’t documented.

## Cargo

Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager.
It uses Git as the default Version Control Syustem (VCS).
Creata new project with
```
cargo new project_name
```

Note: TOML means Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language.
It is Cargo’s configuration format.

In Rust, packages of code are referred to as ‘crates’ (for the [dependencies] section).
